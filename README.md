This is the companion page to the submission to EUSIPCO 2024
"Reconstructing Analytic Dinosaurs: Polynomial Eigenvalue Decomposition for Eigenvalues with Unmajorised Ground Truth" by Sebastian J. Schlecht and Stephan Weiss.
The paper is currently under review.

The MATLAB code reproduces all figures and values from the paper for best reproducibility.

The code relies on the PEVD Toolbox which can be found here:
